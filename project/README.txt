About Idéum
-----------

The goal of Idéum is to enable citizens to improve their community by creating
and sharing ideas and issues about their community. With ideas for improvement
being shared and discussed government can become a better decision maker by
tapping into the expertise of citizens.

While there are many similar applications, Idéum strives to spread ideas and
pick up discussions in other channels to reach as many citizens as possible
through their preferred communication channel. The value of an idea increase as
it is shared and discussed.

To increase chances of reaching relevant citizens, ideas are placed in
geographical and topic contexts. Idéum has an open API to enable integration
and sharing of data across platforms enabling widgets and other channels. 

Idéum includes icons from the Tango Desktop Project: http://tango.freedesktop.org/
