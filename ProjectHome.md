# An open source idea forum for better government decision making #

**Please note:** This project is not associated with [Ideum, Inc.](http://www.ideum.com/) the software and hardware development firm based in the United States.

The goal of Ideum is to enable citizens to improve their community by creating and sharing ideas. With ideas for improvement being shared and discussed government can become a better decision maker by tapping into the expertise of citizens.

While there are many similar applications, Ideum strives to spread ideas and pick up discussions in other channels to reach as many citizens as possible through their preferred communication channel. The value of an idea increase as it is shared and discussed.

To increase chances of reaching relevant citizens, ideas are placed in geographical and topic contexts. Ideum has an open API to enable integration and sharing of data across platforms enabling widgets and other channels.

Extending Ideum to support Fix-it-type requests should be a simple task.
